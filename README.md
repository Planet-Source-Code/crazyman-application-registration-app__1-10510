## Application Registration App


</div>

### Description

Consists of two parts.

1. a server in which you add clients names when they pay you the registration cash.

2.A dll which you use in your apps to register & de-register the user on-line, also checks if the user is registred already.

This is version 1.0, i am going to continue this with greater encryption routines and lots more advanced features.

Register the formshaper.ocx

User must be online to register.

In order for a user to free up a licence he/she must unregister on one machine before he/she can use the key on another machine.
